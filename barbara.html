        <p>
            Hello, I am Barbara. 
            <br> 
            At the time of Santa’s murder, I was busy making a Christmas cake in the kitchen.  
            My husband went out for an hour for a pint with his friends (or I think).
            <br>
            He then returned looking very white and frightened; he said he was just cold.  
            My husband jokingly told you he was thinking of becoming a hit man.
