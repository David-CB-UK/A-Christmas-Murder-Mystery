        <p>
            Hello, I am Patch, I', an Elf.
            <br> 
            My favourite toy to make is Jack in The Boxes because they scare people.

        <p>
        He is an Elf. His most outstanding feature is your eyes; they are icy blue and really stand out against his costume.  
        <br>
        He is wearing a blue costume with silver pointy shoes and yellow tights, and a has a long pointy blue hat.

        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>
        He saw the stable boy, and later someone in a shirt and trousers nears the stables; he remembers thinking they looked cold.
        <br>
        He seems to really love Christmas and is full of Christmas cheer.
