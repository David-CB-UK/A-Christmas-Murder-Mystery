        <!-- THE MURDERER! He was hired by the FBI to kill SATAN following a number of criminal activities, 
         however due to the fact that he is dyslexic and not very good at reading, 
         he did not understand the person he was supposed to kill and thought it said SANTA not SATAN.  
         He has therefore killed Santa.  
         He must make up a story to tell people about where he was during the murder. -->

            Hello, I am Scrooge.  
            <br> 
            I was watching Santa Claus the movie in my living room at the time of the murder, whilst putting up my Christmas tree.  
            <br>
            I was really impressed that I managed to get my old Christmas lights working from last year!
