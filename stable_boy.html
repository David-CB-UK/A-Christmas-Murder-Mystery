        <p>
            Hello, I am Noel.
            <br> 
            I am the stable boy; I am 17 years old and it is my first job.
            <br>
            I have to give hay to the reindeer and brush them. 
            <br>
            I also have to make sure they eat well so they are fit to fly Santa’s sleigh.  
            <br>
            I was the one who found Santa dead, hanging from the fairy lights.  
            <br>
            ...it petrified me!
